The academics with bachelors, masters degree's in computer science that have been in data science for a small time (Question 8). And another larger group where these features are not dominant. Also, the male gender is very percistent and it's fair to asume a precense of female gender in both groups as there isn't a aglomeration of them. <br> The second group agrees in the priorities of education in ML (Question 41) as in the academia there isn't a clear component on the subject (they don't agree in those priorities).\n",
